# Antibacterial Peptide Binary Classification

Predictive models that can determine, given an antibacterial peptide, whether it is also an antibiofilm peptide.

(*NOTE: the dataset is imbalanced*)

The accuracy is measured by `Matthewsâ€™s correlation coefficient (MCC)`

## Preprocess

- `2-mers` or `3-mers`
- Optionally apply `PCA`

## Methods

- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Support Vector Machine
- K-nearest Neightbor Classifier
